# Legacy_of_Wesmere Development Principles

Our main task is not to create a brand new campaign that has nothing in common with the original "Legend of Wesmere" except names of the protagonists but to develop the original idea to its fullest extent with maximum quality, emphasizing its strengths and fixing its flaws.

We won't automatically discard controversial things (like scenarios with multiple sides controlled by players or Kalenz/Lander fight in the context of MP version). Instead we rework them in such a way that preserves the original spirit as much as possible while eliminating players' discomfort.

We want this campaign to stay hybrid, so it's both SP and MP.

We don't want to rewrite characters, only to add to the existing base.

Our strongest conviction is that deep immersive gameplay can be achieved solely through the standard Wesnoth mechanics.

We don't want our rework to affect high-quality addons tied to the Wesnoth timeline.

The campaign should be accesible to the widest possible audience: Easy is playable even by a new player, Hard presents tactical challenge even for an experienced player.
