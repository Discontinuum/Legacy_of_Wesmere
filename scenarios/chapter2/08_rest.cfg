Orcs have reached Lintanir in force, and even as we speak they bore themselves deeper into our beloved forest, cutting and burning warpaths sweeping to and fro, as if searching for something, though we know not what. We have long heard the song of your triumph against this vile foe, and so we have come seeking your council."
