Under your command, Wesmere has found herself caught in a storm, with mild victories following bitter defeats, streams of elven blood flowing from every nook of this realm and beyond. This Council requires an explanation. How did you let yourself be taken by saurians and twice leave open this citadel to siege?"

Brurbar commands a force tenfold greater, bolstered by our old enemies, the nagas and trolls, which his evil will unites against us. What is more, he has a talent for strategy... which I underestimated."

So I called a retreat to Wesmere. Along the way, saurians ambushed us under cover of night and subdued me with their spells. I was dragged to Saurgrath where for the longest time they tried to ascertain from me the whereabouts of a “Stone” of which I knew nothing. Their emperor threatened to deliver war and total annihilation to Wesmere if I would not surrender it."
