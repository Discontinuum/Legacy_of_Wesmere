            story=_ "Though not of noble birth, Kalenz showed early promise in the arts of his people. His quick intelligence gained him more than usual respect among elders normally inclined to pay little heed to anyone younger than a century old."

            story=_ "Kalenz's best friend has always been Landar, ever since their childhood. He too attracted the attention of elders, at first because of a knack for mischief and pranks. But there was no real harm in the boy, and his jokes made him popular among the younger elves."

            story=_ "Perhaps the elders sensed that changing times would require more flexible minds; these were the years when humans from the Green Isle were establishing themselves south of the Great River, and the known world was changing more rapidly than it had for a thousand years before."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story=_ "Some changes were good. The elves, awakened as from a long dream, began to increase in number. Yet others were most foul, and worst of those was the coming of the orcs, the wreckers, the tree-killers. The elves had never been a martial people and they were not prepared for the inevitable war with the orcs."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story=_ "The years of Kalenz' and Landar's long childhoods were a golden age and the last time of untroubled peace. The friends came of age in the very year that Erlornas of Wesmere fought the first orcish raiders. Within the next decade orcish raids greatly increased and their shadow loomed ever greater over the elves.

This is the story of Kalenz, Landar, and of the elves in the first days of a perilous new age."
