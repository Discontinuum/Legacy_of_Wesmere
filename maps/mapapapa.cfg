# This file was generated using the scenario editor.

# If you edit this file by hand, then do not use macros.
# The editor doesn't support macros, and so using them will result in only being able to edit the map.
# Additionally, the contents of all [side] and [time] tags as well as any events that have an id starting with 'editor_event-' are replaced entirely.
# Any manual changes made to those will be lost.
